# vininfo contributing

## Submit issues

If you spotted something weird in application behavior or want to propose a feature you are welcome.


## Write code

If you are eager to participate in application development and to work on an existing issue (whether it should
be a bugfix or a feature implementation), fork, write code, and make a pull request right from the forked project page.


## Spread the word

If you have some tips and tricks or any other words that you think might be of interest for the others â€” publish it
wherever you find convenient.
